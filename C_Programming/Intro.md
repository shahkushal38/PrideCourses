Header files -- 

#include<stdio.h>   standard input output file
#include<conio.h>   console input output

    getch();
}

## Data Types and Variables 

C allows us to store different types of data

Variables are containers that store information or data.

Primitive Data Types
int
char
float

Non Primitive Data Types 

Arrays
Structure
Union
String

Variables 

-- It should not contain any space
-- It should not start with a number, capital letter or special character
-- It should follow camel casing noOfDays
-- It should not be any negative numbers 


Variable Declaration

int a;
Integer -- accepts only integer values; 4 byts  %d
char chr;
any Character in single quotes - eg 'a', 'B', '^';  1 byte or 2 bytes %c
float flt;
Float - decimal values  -  8 bytes %f


Variable Initialization
giving value to a variable

a =10;
int a = 10;

or
int a;
a=10;


char chr = 'a';
