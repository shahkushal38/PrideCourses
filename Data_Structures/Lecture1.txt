1) Count Number of Digits

2) Arithmetic and Geometric Progression 

Arithmetic Progression
nth term = a + (n-1)d 
Sum of AP = n/2 (2a + (n-1)d)

Geometric Progression
nth term of a GP = a*r ^(n-1).
Geometric Mean = nth root of the product of n terms in the GP.
Sum of ‘n’ terms of a GP (r < 1) = [a (1 – r^n)] / [1 – r].
Sum of ‘n’ terms of a GP (r > 1) = [a (r^n – 1)] / [r – 1].
Sum of infinite terms of a GP (r < 1) = (a) / (1 – r).

3) Quadratic equations 

ax^2 + bx +c = 0

roots = (-b ± √(b2 - 4ac))/2a

4) Mean and Median

5) Prime Numbers - 

- Naive Method for Prime Number
- Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm

Using Sieve of Eratosthenes is the most efficient way of generating prime numbers up to a given number N.

Following is the algorithm to find all the prime numbers less than or equal to a given integer n by Eratosthenes' method:
 

1. Create a list of consecutive integers from 2 to n: (2, 3, 4, ..., n).
2. Initially, let p equal 2, the first prime number.
3. Starting from p2, count up in increments of p and mark each of these numbers greater than or equal to p2 itself in the list. These numbers will be p(p+1), p(p+2), p(p+3), etc..
4. Find the first number greater than p in the list that is not marked. If there was no such number, stop. Otherwise, let p now equal this number (which is the next prime), and repeat from step 3.

6) LCM and HCF 
finding GCD using Euclidean Algorithm:
gcd(a, b)
{
    if (a == 0)
        return b;

    return gcd(b % a, a);
}

Time Complexity: O(log(min(a, b)))

Important properties of LCM and HCF:
For two numbers say, 'a' and 'b', LCM x HCF = a x b.
HCF of co-primes = 1.
For two fractions,
HCF = HCF (Numerators) / LCM (Denominators)
LCM = LCM (Numerators) / HCF (Denominators)
