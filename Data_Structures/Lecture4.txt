Introduction to Matrix

A matrix represents a collection of numbers arranged in order of rows and columns. It is necessary to enclose the elements of a matrix in parentheses or brackets.

Order of a Matrix : The order of a matrix is defined in terms of its number of rows and columns.

Transpose of a Matrix: The transpose [M]T of an m x n matrix [M] is the n x m matrix obtained by interchanging the rows and columns of [M].

Properties of transpose of a matrix:
 
(AT)T = A
(A+B)T = AT + BT
(AB)T = BTAT




Properties of Matrix addition and multiplication:
 
A+B = B+A (Commutative)
(A+B)+C = A+ (B+C) (Associative)
AB â‰  BA (Not Commutative)
(AB) C = A (BC) (Associative)
A (B+C) = AB+AC (Distributive)
